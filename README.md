# CIS30A-Course-Project
Smiski Yoga Studio Program

The aim of this project is to create a program for a small yoga studio. The UI assists potential students in learning about the instructors, styles of yoga taught, and a way to view the class schedule and sign up. User information is not stored in a separate file. Nothing is saved once the program stops running. 

Be sure to have the tkinter and pillow modules installed prior to running this code.

`pip3.10 install tkinter`
`pip3.10 install pillow`
