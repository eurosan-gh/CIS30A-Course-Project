# CIS30A-Course-Project
Smiski Yoga Studio Program

The aim of this project is to create a program for a small yoga studio. The UI assists potential students in learning about the instructors, styles of yoga taught, and a way to view the class schedule and sign up. User information is not stored in a separate file. Nothing is saved once the program stops running.
